            <p class='govuk-body'>Appendix C within the RSR guidance contains a poster that practitioners use in order to determine whether offences are scored as ‘violent’. For example, drunkenness is a violent offence in this context.</p>
            <p class='govuk-body'>If a sanction includes both violent and nonviolent offences, it should be counted as violent, even if the primary offence is nonviolent. </p>

            <p class='govuk-body'>Please note: not all the offences in the guidance are, on first glance, violent in themselves. However, we have evidence from OASys Assessment data that the offences are either:</p>

All three of these conditions must be met to classify as ‘knowing’. The exception to this is when two people have been communicating via a webcam/video-conferencing; in this situation, they may not have physically met, but could still be classed as ‘knowing’ each other.</p>

            <p class='govuk-body'>Apply the following principles:</p>
            <p class='govuk-body'>Convictions related to intent or attempt to seek sexual contact with a live human being are considered within the <strong>contact adult</strong> and <strong>contact child</strong> offending groups. Any offending that involves causing or attempting to cause a victim to be involved in sexual activity without lawful consent can be considered a contact offence even where no physical contact has taken place e.g. within an online environment. This would include causing a child to witness sexual activity, because in this example there is an intent to cause a child to be involved with a sexual act.</p>
            <p class='govuk-body'>Offences with a sexual motivation that did not involve causing or attempting to cause a victim to be involved in sexual activity without lawful consent should be classed as non-contact e.g. voyeurism or upskirting.</p>
            <p class='govuk-body'>Class offences as <strong>contact adult</strong> if there are any victims aged 16 or over, or <strong>contact child</strong> if aged under 16.</p>

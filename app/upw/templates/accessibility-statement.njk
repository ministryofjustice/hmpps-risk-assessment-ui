                    change colours, contrast levels and fonts
                </li>
                <li> 
                    navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li> 
                    listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

It is important that assumptions are not made about these issues and that time is taken at the assessment stage to establish with the individual how this could affect work placement allocation.
           For example, does a reasonable adjustment need to be made so they can have time and a suitable space to pray during the working day?

        <p> 
            Give priority to the management of risk of serious harm and likelihood of reoffending. The presence or proximity of children or vulnerable adults and potential opportunities for further offending should be considered in the light of assessment information and the current Risk of Serious Harm (RoSH) assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where the offence has resulted in serious harm to a victim the nature of the offence must be considered to ensure that the placement is appropriate and does not risk contact between the individual and the victim or victims.

        <p> 
           When allocating a person who has a current or previous conviction for a sexual offence to a project, consideration must be given to avoiding any contact with children or vulnerable people. Where necessary, staff should be aware of the nature of the convictions and arrangements for the individualâ€™s safety in the event of any disclosure about these offences.

        <p> 
           Does this individual have a conviction, or is there any evidence to indicate that they pose a risk of harm to children? Community Payback work should not include direct personal care or supervision of a child or vulnerable adult. If Community Payback work takes place on premises to which (a) the public do not have access and (b) children or vulnerable adults are present, then before a placement can be considered there must be a clear record on the case management system that the individual is not barred from working with children or vulnerable adults.

            Violent offences?

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
            History of acquisitive offending?

            Are there any risk management issues if working in a supervised group?
        </h4>
        <p> 
            To help manage the dynamics of the group it's helpful to avoid placing co-defendants, family members or anti-social peers on the same project. Please identify any person the individual should not be placed with.

The maximum time travelling under supervision that can be credited against Unpaid Work hours is 60 minutes each way. Where more than 30 minutes is spent travelling to a pick-up point there should be a corresponding reduction in the time considered to be spent in a Community Payback vehicle, up to the 90-minute maximum. Conversely a maximum 90 minutes total travel time can be used where the supervised individual reports directly to a work site.
        </p>

            Where a placement could involve multiple work sites (e.g. litter picking) only the travel time to the initial project site is relevant to this measure.

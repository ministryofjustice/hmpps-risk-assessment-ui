Any offending that involves causing or attempting to cause a victim to be involved in sexual activity without lawful consent can be considered a contact offence even where no physical contact has taken place e.g. within an online environment. This would include causing a child to witness sexual activity, because in this example there is an intent to cause a child to be involved with a sexual act.</p>
                    <p class='govuk-body'>Offences with a sexual motivation that did not involve causing or attempting to cause a victim to be involved in sexual activity without lawful consent should be classed as non-contact e.g. voyeurism or upskirting.</p>
                    <p class='govuk-body'>Class offences as <strong>contact adult</strong> if there are any victims aged 16 or over, or <strong>contact child</strong> if aged under 16.</p>
